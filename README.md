Adverse Effects Analysis of Tramal and Lyrica using FAERS 2019 Data

Overview
This repository contains the analysis and comparison of adverse effects of two medications, Tramal and Lyrica, which are commonly used to treat neurological pain. The analysis is based on the FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) datasets for the year 2019.

# Project Description
PwC, in collaboration with a network of doctors from Germany, aims to find the possible adverse effects of drugs used to treat neurological pain. This project involves:

Creating a descriptive overview of adverse effects of Tramal.
Comparing these effects with another medication, Lyrica.
Suggesting further investigations to determine which drug might be preferable based on adverse effects.
Data Source
The FAERS dataset contains information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to the FDA. The data is available on a quarterly basis and has been merged for the year 2019 for this analysis.

Steps for Analysis
Step 1: Descriptive Overview of Adverse Effects of Tramal
Load and Merge Datasets

Download and load the four quarterly datasets from FAERS for 2019.
Merge these datasets into a single DataFrame.
Extract Adverse Effects for Tramal

Filter the data to include only reports related to Tramal.
Identify and count the frequency of each adverse effect.
Determine the 10 most common adverse effects.
Visualization

Create a bar plot to display the top 10 adverse effects of Tramal.
Step 2: Comparison with Lyrica
Extract Adverse Effects for Lyrica

Filter the data to include only reports related to Lyrica.
Identify and count the frequency of each adverse effect.
Determine the 10 most common adverse effects.
Comparison

Compare the top 10 adverse effects of Tramal with those of Lyrica.
Highlight similarities and differences.
Visualization

Create comparative bar plots for the adverse effects of Tramal and Lyrica.
Step 3: Suggestions for Further Investigations
Define Investigation Criteria

Propose criteria for further investigation based on frequency and severity of adverse effects.
Suggest analyzing patient demographics for susceptibility to specific adverse effects.
Additional Analysis

Recommend longitudinal studies to track adverse effects over time.
Suggest further comparisons of efficacy and adverse effects in different patient populations.

Results
The results of the analysis are presented in the PowerPoint slide deck. The deck includes:

A descriptive overview of the adverse effects of Tramal.
A comparison of adverse effects between Tramal and Lyrica.
Suggestions for further investigations based on the analysis.
